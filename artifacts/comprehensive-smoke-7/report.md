# Installed-hook lifecycle benchmark

This is a synthetic, author-written benchmark, not an independent product ranking.
Both products ran unchanged. Repeated timings are not extra accuracy cases.
A caught defect requires a matching diagnostic on every repetition.
Post-write detection means the bytes already landed.

Corpus version: 2.
Corpus SHA-256: `4648d3277a8453fd45f1b6834b38cba26e207891528d8755a7447284c49aada3`.

## Matched results

| Profile / product | Caught defects | Prevented before write | False blocks | Control feedback | Coverage warnings | Infrastructure errors |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| shared/interlinked | 0/1 | 0/1 | 0/2 | 2/2 | 3/3 | 0 |
| shared/loki | 0/1 | 0/1 | 0/2 | 0/2 | 0/3 | 0 |

Control feedback includes legitimate advisory and unavailable-coverage notices.
It is not a false-positive count. False blocks include any blocked repetition.
Infrastructure errors stay in denominators and earn no detection credit.

## Shared-analyzer results by language

| Language | Product | Caught | Pre-write | False blocks |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| typescript | loki | 0/1 | 0/1 | 0/2 |
| typescript | interlinked | 0/1 | 0/1 | 0/2 |

## Paired cases

A successful pair catches the defect on every run and never blocks its control.
Pair counts exclude standalone admission, scaling, debt, and workflow cases.

| Profile / product | Successful pairs |
| --- | ---: |
| shared/interlinked | 0/0 |
| shared/loki | 0/0 |

## Hook latency

Milliseconds, including process and sandbox startup. Post-write latency excludes denied writes.
First invocation uses a fresh product process/fixture, not cold OS page caches.
Startup-warmed trials use their own fresh fixture/daemon, with two git-status hook envelopes first. No compiler-result cache is prewarmed.
Pooled timings mix languages and different amounts of work; do not treat them as a speed ranking.

| Profile / product | Cache | Pre median / p95 | Post median / p95 | Total median / p95 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| shared/interlinked | first-invocation | 129.33 / 148.88 | 5975.80 / 6042.59 | 6105.13 / 6191.47 |
| shared/interlinked | startup-warmed | 116.24 / 136.54 | 6003.64 / 6115.23 | 6119.87 / 6239.49 |
| shared/loki | first-invocation | 185.85 / 214.70 | 379.13 / 412.37 | 563.37 / 593.83 |
| shared/loki | startup-warmed | 151.67 / 158.08 | 443.49 / 465.37 | 598.68 / 620.45 |

## Explicit Go/Rust audit commands

Separate from ordinary hooks. Loki runs `scan --base HEAD`; Interlinked runs `verify --json`.
The commands have product-defined scopes. No claim of identical internal checks.

| Product | Targeted defects found | Controls exiting zero |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| loki | 0/0 | 0/0 |
| interlinked | 0/0 | 0/0 |

## Misses and unrelated blocks

- interlinked: `workflow/typescript/multi-file-repair` step 0: missed.
- loki: `workflow/typescript/multi-file-repair` step 0: missed.

## False blocks and instability


## Coverage and limitations

Steps with post-hook byte changes: {}.
Steps with unexpected pre-hook byte changes: 0.

- Author-written cases are not independent or representative of production.
- First invocation is not an OS-cold disk/cache measurement.
- Additional context can be advisory; post-write findings do not prevent bytes landing.
- Generic denial without a target marker is not credited as targeted prevention.
- Real host activation and explicit audit scans are separate from hook effectiveness.
- Go/Rust audit commands have different product-defined scopes.
- Cases include intentional policy violations, compiler errors, and semantic security gaps.
- No live model writes, production repositories, long-running autonomous sessions, or cloud services.
- The missing-JS profile removes project-local JS tools; it is not a no-tools machine.
- The main profile supplies Biome's recommended config to both products and uses installed product policy otherwise.
- Source formatting for Go, Rust, and Elixir happens before each proposed edit, outside measured hook time.
- Native command hooks are invoked as installed. Separate live-host probes only establish startup activation.

Raw handler output, exact corpus, schedule, tool versions, hashes, and audit output are in adjacent JSON files.
